A Full Stack MERN application called "Memories". It is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

This project was built using React, Material-UI, Node.js, Express & MongoDB.

I've uploaded a video demo since I've faced some issues to deploy the project via free hosting websites.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVtTSnJEy-g-dhFP36DWH2alKtrfQ9-v/view?usp=sharing
